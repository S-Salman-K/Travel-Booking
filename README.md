## **Projet Description **

All-in-one Travel Booking App According to a report published by US Travel Association, travel spending in the USA has tallied at $92 billion for the month of December 2021. The data shows that only 2% of spending has been dropped compared to the month of December 2019. Even though the pandemic occurred during this time, the travel industry didnâ€™t lose its existence and continued to lead in the market. So, developing an all-in-one travel booking solution could be an opportunity to tap into the travel industry. This project idea of the app will allow your users to book tickets for trains, buses, flights, hotels, and ferries. Booking and managing traveling journeys from a single app offer the benefits of saving time and effort. In fact, many applications such as Booking.com or Trip give offers and discounts on bookings to the customers. This lures customers to keep on using their applications. Using such an app benefits to plan trips from a single place that includes choosing a destination, booking cars for sightseeing, and travelling to local places of the holiday destination. Developing an app on this full-stack project idea becomes a one-stop solution for all travel-loving people. Such apps make it easy for your users to manage the whole travel journey from a single online booking platform. Which are the Core Features of All-in-one Travel Booking App?
